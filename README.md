<h1><b> Udacity project 1 - Seattle AirBnb Open Dataset </b></h1>

This projects is part of the first project of the Udacity Data Science NanoDegree. 
Using the Seattle AirBnB open dataset we will answer 3 questions that affect airbnb flat prices. Factors like locatiton, seasonality and others.


<h2><b>Getting Started</b></h2>

To get started you will need to signup to Google Colab and Kaggle. Once done you will need to download an API token from "My Account" in www.kaggle.com.
This will be used to link the kaggle api and google colab as per the instructions in the python notebook. 

<h2><b>Prerequisites</b></h2>

No software needs to be installed as everything will run on the cloud if you run it on google colab.

<h2><b>Libraries Used</b></h2>

Pandas
Numpy 
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly

<h2><b>Files used in the project with small description</b></h2>


In this project we used 2 files:
listings.csv - summary information on listing in Seattle such as: location, host information, cleaning and guest fees, amenities etc.
calendar.csv - calendar data for the listings: availability dates, price for each date

<h2><b>Summary </b></h2>

Our findings were that the prices are affected by the season, location and space. Meaning that ceratin neibhourhoods have almost double the prices of others. Prices in the summer are up to 50% higher and the more beds and bedrooms a flat has the higher the price as per the below graphs
